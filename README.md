# Smart-Clock-Widget
The "Smart Clock Widget" project aims to develop a Java-based  application for desktops that offers an intuitive and customizable clock  widget with smart features. The widget will be able to display the current  time and date, and users will be able to customize its appearance, such as choosing between different themes, font sizes, and colors
LIBRARIES USED
JavaFX:
JavaFX is a Java-based framework for building desktop and mobile 
applications. It provides a set of libraries and tools for creating rich 
graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
JavaFX applications can be run on desktop platforms, such as Windows, 
mac OS, and Linux, as well as on mobile devices, such as Android and 
iOS, using a special version of the framework called JavaFX Mobile.
Features of JavaFX:-
1. Java library
2. Platform Independent
3. FXML
4. Scene Builder
5. Hardware accelerated Graphics pipeline
6. Built-in UI controls
7. CSS Styling
8. Rich set of APIs
9. High-performance

GSON:
Gson is a Java library developed by Google that is used to convert Java 
Objects into their JSON representation and vice versa. The name "Gson" 
is a combination of "Google" and "JSON". Gson provides methods to 
serialize Java objects to JSON and de-serialize JSON to Java objects.

OpenWeatherMap API:
OpenWeatherMap API is a weather data provider that offers a range of 
weather-related data such as current weather conditions, forecasts, 
historical data, and more, for various locations around the world. The 
OpenWeatherMap API can be accessed via HTTP requests and supports 
various data formats including JSON, XML, and HTML.
To use the OpenWeatherMap API, you need to sign up for an API key, 
which is required to access the data. Once you have the API key, you can 
use it to make HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API endpoints 
and receive weather data in the desired format. The API documentation 
provides detailed information on the available endpoints and 
parameters, as well as examples of how to use the API in various 
programming languages.
Label: 
A label is an instance of the javafx.scene.control.Label class, which 
provides various properties and methods to customize its appearance 
and behaviour. For example, you can set the text displayed by the label 
using the setText() method, change its font size and colour using the 
setFont() and setTextFill() methods respectively, and align the text using 
the setAlignment() method. Overall, labels are an important component 
of JavaFX user interfaces and are frequently used to provide information 
and feedback to the user.
ComboBox:
In JavaFX, a ComboBox is a user interface control that combines a text 
field and a drop-down list of items from which the user can choose. The 
user can either type in a value directly in the text field or select an item 
from the drop-down list.


LocalDate and LocalTime are classes that represent date and time values 
without a time zone or offset. They are part of the java.time package, 
which was introduced in Java 8 as part of the Date-Time API. Both 
LocalDate and LocalTime are immutable class, which means that their 
values cannot be changed once they are created.
JsonObject, JsonElement and JsonParser:
In Java, JsonObject, JsonElement, and JsonParser are classes from the 
javax.json package, which provides a lightweight and flexible way to 
process and generate JSON data.
HBox and VBox are layout panes that allow you to arrange UI controls 
horizontally or vertically, respectively. Here's a brief overview of each 
layout pane:
HBox: HBox is a layout pane that arranges its child nodes in a 
horizontal row. You can add child nodes to an HBox using its 
getChildren().add() method, and you can set various properties of the 
HBox, such as its spacing and alignment, using its various setter 
methods.
VBox: VBox is a layout pane that arranges its child nodes in a vertical 
column. You can add child nodes to a VBox using its getChildren().add() 
method, and you can set various properties of the VBox, such as its 
spacing and alignment, using its various setter methods.
